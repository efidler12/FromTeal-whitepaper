# fromTeal Whitepaper

## Purpose
- There were these special times & places in history, when a confluence of artists or engineers grouped together to create something really great, that didn't just advance our evolution as a species, but also left many generations afterwards with so much joy & appreciation. Think of Paris in the time of Dada & Surrealism, London in the time of Russel & Wittgenstein, New York in the time of Warhol & the Velvet Underground or Palo Alto in the time of TCP/IP & Xerox PARC.

- fromTeal is a digital place for artists & engineers to group together & create great things, while fairly splitting the value created.
