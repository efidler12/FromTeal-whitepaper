# fromTeal Whitepaper

## Purpose
- There were these special times & places in history, when a confluence of artists or engineers grouped together to create something really great, that didn't just advance our evolution as a species, but also left many generations afterwards with so much joy & appreciation. Think of Paris in the time of Dada & Surrealism, London in the time of Russel & Wittgenstein, New York in the time of Warhol & the Velvet Underground or Palo Alto in the time of TCP/IP & Xerox PARC.

- However, there are much more examples of artists & engineers that didn't know about each other, even though they were working on the same things.

- There are also very little examples of groups that created something great, but were able to encorporate as a business to make a living out of their passion.

- With the Web, it's much easier today to discover others sharing the same passion or purpose, & group together. With the new Web3, it is also becoming easier to split the value created in the group, in a fair way.

- fromTeal is a digital place for artists, engineers & any other world changers, to group together & create great things, while fairly splitting the value created.



## Overview
fromTeal is a digital world (special-purpose metaverse) designed to enable 3 main functions, in a practical & effective way:
1. Help engineers, artists, scientists & entrepreneurs to discover like-minded others who share the same passion or purpose, & form a group to pursue that passion or purpose together
2. It then helps them organize in a way that maximizes their freedom & creativity, just like a self-organized Hackathon team, while still maintaining a governance model regulating decision making, conflict resolution &c.
3. While doing that, it also keeps tap of the equity share of each member of the group, so that whenever they have profits or any other commercial liquidity, they can share it in a fair way.
