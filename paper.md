# fromTeal Whitepaper

## Purpose
- Throughuot history, there were several special times & places when a confluence of artists or engineers grouped together to create something really great, that didn't just advance our evolution as a species, but also left many generations afterwards with so much joy & appreciation. Think of Paris in the time of Dada & Surrealism, London in the time of Russel & Wittgenstein, New York in the time of Warhol & the Velvet Underground or Palo Alto in the time of TCP/IP & Xerox PARC.

- However, there are much more examples of artists & engineers that didn't know about each other, even though they were working on the same things.

- There are also very little examples of groups that created something great, but were able to encorporate as a business to make a living out of their passion.

- With the Web, it's much easier today to discover others sharing the same passion or purpose, & group together. With the new Web3, it is also becoming easier to split the value created in the group, in a fair way.

- fromTeal is a digital place for artists, engineers & any other world changers, to group together & create great things, while fairly splitting the value created.



## Overview
fromTeal is a digital world (special-purpose metaverse) designed to enable 3 main functions, in a practical & effective way:
1. Help engineers, artists, scientists & entrepreneurs to discover like-minded others who share the same passion or purpose, & form a group to pursue that passion or purpose together
2. It then helps them organize in a way that maximizes their freedom & creativity (just like a self-organized Hackathon team) while still maintaining a governance model that regulates decision making, conflict resolution &c.
3. As the group work together, fromTeal also keeps tap of the equity share of each member, so that whenever they have profits or any other commercial liquidity, they can share it in a fair way.

### Discovery & group forming
To help the discovery of other like-minded people sharing the same passion or purpose, fromTeal organizes the digital world into Islands, Lots & Buildings, that are organized around different purposes, problems, art forms, technologies or research areas. This works just like in cities you have neighborhoods or streets concentrating fashion stores, car dealers, house decor stores, or restaurants, so that you can discover what you need by wondering around. Each Island is created for a specific purpose or passion, each lot within it is created for a more specific problem or area, & each building in a lot serves as the virtual HQ for a group working together.

### Organization & governance
fromTeal is leveraging a way of organization & governance known as Teal or Holacracy, that was proven to be very effective with companies & organization that maximize the freedom & creativity of their members, to achieve extraordinary results. The main principle behind this governance model is that if people are driven by the same purpose, you don't need to have managers telling them what to do, but instead you can assume they'll be able to self-manage & self-organize themselves towards achieving their purpose. This means that everyone can make decisions by themselves, as long as they ask for advice from other stakeholders. Having this level of freedom, essentially make everyone fully leverage their creativity & capabilities, as they're all working as owners & not employees following orders.

### Equity & splitting of value
fromTeal defines a way for groups working together to keep tap of the equity share of each member, by allowing them to earn equity tokens of the group, in proportion to their level of contribution. These equity tokens are solely recording the equity shares, so that whenever the group has commercial profits, or their IP or whole group is being acquired, they can split the value between them in a fair way. For now, these equity tokens aren't meant to facilitate trade or investment, so members can't transfer or sell them to others. The group can still award non-group members with equity tokens for their contribution, but it won't have liquidity until there is splitting of value.



## How it works
The fromTeal digital world is actually an information system with a new UI paradigm for working with information. Every entity in this information system is represented by a 3D object, whose state is managed in an L2 blockchain, facilitating the governance & equity functionality in a decentralized way. 

### Example scenario
